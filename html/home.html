            <h2>My Crochet Journey</h2>
            <p>
                I've been crocheting many years now, and I wanted to share how I first got into it. My first experience was in maybe 2013 in my sophomore year of high school.
                I remember seeing a cute knit elephant and wanting to make one. I tried following a pattern in a book I borrowed from the library,
                and I miserably failed at it because I couldn't get the basics of knitting down.
            </p>
            <p>
                I still wanted to make cute dolls with yarn, and I saw that you could also achieve that through crocheting.
                This time, I made sure to watch some Youtube videos to learn some of the basics.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first crochet project was an amigurumi turtle from Youtube. I'm pretty sure I ended up throwing it out because I didn't think it was very good.
                I wish I took a picture of it so I could see my progress from my first ever project to now, but it's too late now ðŸ¥²
            <p>
                I probably worked on some other projects, but the first ever amigurumi that I was proud of was a different turtle from a book.
                I even posted it on Instagram, ugly filters and all ðŸ˜‚

            <p>
                Because of school, I had been crocheting on an off again, but I fell back in love with it during COVID.
                I definitely have been whipping out more amigurumi over the past couple of years, and I even started my own crochet Instagram last year.
                I'm not the greatest at updating it, but I want to try documenting my crochet projects more, hence this crochet blog.

                Thank you for reading this far! This crochet blog is just going to be a place where I write about anything related to crochet.
                I hope I can start writing my own patterns in the future, and I'll be writing about them here! I hope you enjoyed reading about my crochet journey
                and will continue on my journey with my blog updates ðŸ™‚

            <h2>Top 5 Amigurumi Tips</h2>
            <p>
                I've been crocheting for a while now, but I'm always learning new techniques to make my amigurumi look better!
                I've compiled a list of some of my favorite ones:

                <ol>
                    <li><a href="https://www.allaboutami.com/invisibledecrease/">Invisible Decrease</a> - great for hiding your decreases</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.planetjune.com/blog/yarn-over-vs-yarn-under-in-crochet/">Yarn Under</a> - makes the stitches tighter and neater</li>
                    <li><a href="http://two-little-cs.blogspot.com/2015/04/day-13-properly-stuffing-your-amigurumi.html">Stuff correctly - stuffing can really change how your amigurmumi looks</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.tinycurl.co/amigurumi-hook-size/">Use a smaller hook than recommended</a> - like the yarn under technique, a smaller hook size can prevent holes and make your stitches tighter</li>
                    <li>Use stitch markers - great for keeping count of your stitches</li>
                </ol>
